# MIPS-Programming
Some works on MIPS programming using SPIM:

Task One: Lottery Odds Program

There are many lottery schemes available across the world. Write a MIPS Assembly language program that will calculate the odds of winning the Jackpot prize.

For example:
	A. The Euro Millions lottery requires matching 5 numbers from a pool of 50 numbers and matching 2 numbers from a second pool of 11 numbers.
	B. The Mega Millions lottery requires matching 5 from 75 and 1 from 15.
	C. The Thunderball lottery requires matching 5 from 39 and matching 1 from 14.
	D. The PowerBall lottery requires matching 5 from 69 and 1 from 26.

The subroutine example on the following page, calculates the Factorial of an input integer. Starting with the code in the example, write a correct program in MIPS - QtSpim assembly language that:
	1. Calculates the odds of winning any of the lottery jackpot grand prizes.
	2. The calculated value is to be displayed on the QtSpim console screen with an appropriate commentary text. Such as “The odds are 1 in nnnn.”
	3. The program is to accept as input:
		An integer representing the large pool of possible numbers.
		A second integer representing the count of numbers to be selected from the large pool.
		An integer representing the size of the second pool of numbers.
		A fourth integer representing the count of numbers to be selected from the second pool.
	4. Test your program by calculating the odds of choosing a set of 2 numbers from a pool of 6 numbers. The value is “1 in 15”. Test other combinations.

Task Two: From Rome to Arabia

Write a correct program in MIPS - QtSpim assembly language that:

	A) To read input Roman Numerals as ASCII text characters.
	B) To calculates the equivalent decimal value.
	C) To write the calculated value as Arabic Numerals (integer) to the QtSpim display screen with the appropriate commentary text.
	D) The program must correctly calculate the values of these seven Roman Numeral digits:
			I V X L C D M 
	E)Calculate the value, and display the result of these Roman Numerals:
			LXXIX
			MMXVI
			MCMXLVIII
			MDCCCCVIIII
